# v-lut-search
An automatic V-LUT generation program that uses these four user-defined parameters as input in order to minimize the effort required to implement different PRNGs 

=========================================================================================================================================================================

matlab code will soon be uploaded.

There are three main parts to this program.

Part 1: Generate large number of matrices according to the user-defined parameters

Part 2: Find all primitive matrices that generated in Part 1. There are 2 steps in Part 2.

	Step 1: Acquire first d+1 vector generated by T, calculate the minimal polynomial P(z) of the sequence. If degree of P(z) is less than d, then the current matrix T is rejected.
	
	Step 2: For each prime factor f of 2d âˆ’ 1, if  , then the matrix is rejected. All matrices that have passed Step 2 are considered primitive.
	
Part 3: Convert primitive matrix T to Verilog code.
